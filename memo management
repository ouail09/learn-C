What is Memory in Your Computer?
Imagine your computer’s memory as a giant bookshelf with lots of
 little cubbies, each one ready to store something important—like a 
 number, a letter, or a piece of information. But there are only so
  many cubbies, so you have to be careful about how much you put on that shelf.

Using malloc to Borrow Memory
Sometimes, you need a special amount of space on the shelf, but
 you don’t know how much until the program is running. For this, we
  use something called malloc, which is like borrowing some space on
   the shelf. malloc stands for "memory allocation," and it gives you
    a chunk of cubbies that your program can use to store data, even if it’s a big amount.

Why free is Important
Once you’re done using that borrowed space, you don’t just leave your 
stuff there forever. You have to use free to tell your program, “Okay, I’m done
 with this space. You can have it back.” If you don’t return it, it’s like leaving
  all your things on the bookshelf and never cleaning up! This would fill
   up your shelf until there’s no room left, and your computer might run
    out of memory space. This is what we call a memory leak—the computer 
    loses track of that space because you didn’t give it back.

So, in Short:
malloc: Borrow some memory space when you need it.
free: Return the space when you’re done, so there’s room for new things.
Memory Leaks: If you don’t return memory, it can get lost, filling up the 
shelf until there’s no more space!
Memory management is all about being responsible with your
 computer’s “shelf space” so everything runs smoothly!
